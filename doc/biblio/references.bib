These social structures vary across countries in different stages of development and with different demographics. Social contact patterns have been measured in a small number of countries, but in large swathes of the world, contact patterns are unmeasured, which makes it challenging to build mathematical or computer models of disease spread and control. In this work, we developed a modelling framework to combine social contact data from the past studies of contact patterns within eight countries in the EU with data from multiple data sources including the Demographic Household Surveys, World Bank and UN Statistics Division, to provide validated approximations to age-and-location-specific contact rates for 152 countries covering 95.9% of the world’s population.},

abstract = {Background The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak in Wuhan, China has attracted worldwide attention. As of February 11, 2020, a total of 44,730 cases of pneumonia associated with the 2019-nCoV were confirmed by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China. Methods Three approaches, namely Poisson likelihood-based method (ML), exponential growth rate-based method (EGR) and stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Removed dynamic model-based method (SIR), were implemented to estimate the basic and controlled reproduction numbers. Results A total of 71 chains of transmission together with dates of symptoms onset and 67 dates of infections were identified among 5,405 confirmed cases outside Hubei as reported by February 2, 2020. Based on this information, we find the serial interval having an average of 4.27 days with a standard deviation of 3.44 days and the infectious period having an average of 10.91 days with a standard deviation of 3.95 days. The estimated controlled reproduction numbers, Common.EditSubmissionSteps.Transform.EquationText, produced by all three methods in all analyzed regions of China are significantly smaller compared with the basic reproduction numbers Common.EditSubmissionSteps.Transform.EquationText. Conclusions The controlled reproduction number is declining. It is lower than one in most regions of China, but still larger than one in Hubei Province. Sustained efforts are needed to further keep/reduce the Common.EditSubmissionSteps.Transform.EquationText to},
