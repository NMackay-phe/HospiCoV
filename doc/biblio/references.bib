  abstract  = {Author summary The risk of infectious disease transmission varies in different settings, for instance at home, at work or in the community, as a result of the different social structures and mixing patterns in those locations. These social structures vary across countries in different stages of development and with different demographics. Social contact patterns have been measured in a small number of countries, but in large swathes of the world, contact patterns are unmeasured, which makes it challenging to build mathematical or computer models of disease spread and control. In this work, we developed a modelling framework to combine social contact data from the past studies of contact patterns within eight countries in the EU with data from multiple data sources including the Demographic Household Surveys, World Bank and UN Statistics Division, to provide validated approximations to age-and-location-specific contact rates for 152 countries covering 95.9% of the world’s population.},
