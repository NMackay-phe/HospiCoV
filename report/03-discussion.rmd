# Discussion

Recap

* the main results in terms of total number of cases, severity, deaths
* the Regions whose capacity will be over-run very soon : Corsica, Grand-Est, and Bourgogne-Franche-Comt√©. 

Comparison with previous work

* Danon 
* Kucharski 
* Chen

Limits

* spatial division of the territory does not reflect administrative boundaries of the French Region
* not accounting for oversee region because they are at a lower epidemic stage for the moment
* estimations limited to one month as to limit bias from external factors such as seasonality
* theoretical ICU capacities do not reflect the number of currently available ICU beds

Opening

* improve accounting of control measures
* assess potential impact of seasonality 
* improve long-term predictions through validation with more accurate hospitalization data

Conclusion

* we are in the caca !
