COVID-19 mortality risk is not only dependant on the intrinsic virus' characteristics, but depends also on health care capacities, especially intensive care units. Italy is already seeing its ICU capacities exceeded, as well as several hospitals in France. However, few studies have tried to forecast ICU needs. Grasselli and colleagues used linear and exponential models to estimate ICU demand in Lombardy, Italy, from March 7 to March 20 [@Grasselli]. They concluded that the health care system could not sustain an uncontrolled outbreak, and that strong containment measures were needed. Here, we found that ICU capacities would be rapidly exceeded in several regions in France, even in optimistic scenarios. Incapacity to provide adequate treatment to critically ill patients could further increase the already substantial death toll of the epidemic.


Limits

Besides limits inherent to every transmission model, this work has several specific limitations. First, long term predictions are likely to be unreliable considering the assumptions made in this model, which is why we are only presenting forecasts at one month. The critical factor that remains unknow to this date, in the potential impact of seasonality to the transmission dynamic of COVID-19. Danon and colleagues modeled seasonal transmission by introducing a time-varying transmission rate. [@danon-medrxiv] They estimated that a 50% reduction in transmission during summer months would result in a smaller epidemic before the summer, followed by a resurgence in cases in the following winter. However, whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission will be affected by seasonal variations remains unclear. Although many infectious diseases have seasonal patterns, like influenza or other coronaviruses, newly introduced viruses can behave differently. Several experts suggest that the impact of seasonality on COVID-19 transmission might be very modest. [@Lipsitch;@Cohen] Second, regarding the prediction of ICU needs, the ICU capacities used in this study are theoretical and based on annual data, [@DREES] and do not reflect exactly current ICU capacities. However, the potential discrepancies are likely to be modest and should not impact the interpretation of the results. Also, we assumed a fixed length of stay of 15 days in ICU. This value could vary across patients and locations, and could slightly bias the estimation of ICU needs. Third, we restricted our model to metropolitan France, as oversee regions are at a lower epidemic stage at the moment, and the transmission dynamics are likely to differ from metropolitan France. Finally, it must be noted that spatial division of the territory this model does not exactly reflect administrative boundaries of the French regions. The division was based on Voronoi polygons representing referral centers' catchment areas. However, division by catchment areas might help to better estimate the pressure on the referral centers, as people are more likely to be referred to hospitals based on geographical distance rather than administrative boundaries.


To mitigate the epidemic, the French government announced a series of nation-wide measures, of increasing importance. On February 29: stopping gatherings of more than 5000 people in confined settings. On March 8: stopping the gatherings of more than 1000 people that are not essential to the life of the Nation. On March 12: closure of schools and universities and recommandations of voluntary household quarantine and social distancing of those over 70 years of age. On March 13: stopping gathering of more that 100 people. On March 14, the stage 3 of the epidemic was declared. In consequence, all non-essential public places are closed, and people are enjoined to stay home as much as possible, limit social interactions, and limit travels. We did not directly implemented these control measures by modifying the contact structures of the model, but their impact was assessed indirectly by modifying the value of the reproduction number. 

Opening

* improve accounting of control measures
* assess potential impact of seasonality 
* improve long-term predictions through validation with more accurate hospitalization data

Conclusion

* we are in the caca !
