# Objective

The objective of this study was to estimate the number of infected cases, hospitalizations and deaths in France in a worst-case scenario of absence, or non-efficacity of control measures, and absence of seasonality. As a sensitivity analysis and to assess the potential impact of large scale control measures, we varied the $R_0$ of the epidemic from 3 to 1.5. We also sought to predict the impact of the epidemic on healthcare capicities, by estimating the number of required hospital beds in intensive care units throughout the epidemic, for each region.

# Methods

We listed the 138 hospitals that are identified as referral centers for the treatment of COVID-19 cases in France. Of those, 33 hospitals are listed as primary referral centers, and 98 as secondary referral centers in metropolitan France and 7 were overseas hospitals (not included). We then divided metropolitan France into hospital catchment areas around these referral hospitals using Voronoi polygons (Figure \ref{maps}). Population structure was inferred for each catchment area from 2016 and 2017 census data provided by the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (Insee) [@INSEE]. Catchment areas were then aggregated by metropolitan Regions [13 French administrative areas with an averaged population of 4.75 millions ranging from 300 000 (Corsica) to 12.55 millions (Ile-de-France)].

Data on ICU beds capacity per French Region were retrieved from the "Statistique Annuelle des Etablissements de Sant√©" (SAE) [@DREES]. 

We developed a deterministic, age-structed, compartmental, Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, as a set of differential equations (Figure \ref{diagram}). The population is divided into 17 age-groups (5 years age-band), and can be either susceptible (S), exposed to the virus but not infectious (E), infected and infectious (I), or removed from the chains of infection (R). We used an inter-individual contacts matrix for the French population estimated by Prem and colleagues [@Prem2017] to simulate age-dependant mixing.

We considered an incubation period of 5 days and a contagious period of 11 days [@Zhou2020].
We estimated the age-dependant susceptibility of the population based on the age distribution of infected cases reported by Wu and colleagues in China [@wu-lancet]. We standardized the Chinese age distribution of cases to the French population to estimate the expected age distribution of cases for France. We then fitted the age dependant susceptibility vector using the R implementation of the subplex algorithm provided by the `nloptr` package.

We assumed an average length of stay in hospital and in ICU wards of 15 days for all patients whatever their age.
