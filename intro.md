To use run the model for a specific country, you must provide the following inputs:

- **Pre-infected table**: a table with a number of infected cases by location (it can be a unique location)
- **Population table**: a table of the age-stratified population for each location. The population must be stratified into the same 17 age groups as the contact matrix.

Age-specific **contact matrices** are made available for 152 countries by Prem et al.

Age groups: 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44,  45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80P
